Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

It was interesting as I went through my assignments to think about how much coding has gone into all of 
the websites that I have visited and that something like a calculator converting centimeters to inches has a 
bunch of code written to make it work properly. I was especially impressed when we did the assignment with family history
and I was able to see how creating a few functions could make finding information in a dictionary very quick and efficient.



2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

To see if the program is working the way it should. I liked the assignment when we were able to test
the functions to see if it would extract the state or zipcode the way it should. Testing functions can save a programmer from
a lot of headache of trying to figure out where the problem is because it helps them narrow it down to which function needs to 
be adjusted. 


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

When I am writing a program I like to check to see if things will print so that I know they are working the
way that they are supposed to before passing them as a parameter into another function. This helps me find the issue
early on rather than writing the whole thing and then having to figure out where the problem is. I also found using the debugger 
helpful, visually scanning my work to see if I mispelled something, and having my terminal open to show me when there are problems. 
The biggest thing I can do to improve is practice a lot so that I can understand the basics better and start getting used to
the syntax of the Python language.
